😁 **What I learned through this course** 😁
 >
 *Through this course I learned how to create repositories, add files, pull requests, commit and push work, as well as other terms commonly used in coding and github. I also learned 
the definition of Github, branches, and forks in coding terms. I also learned how the process of cloning repositories works as well as the the process of creating seperate repositories with different files and descriptions through readme files.*

🤔 **What I'm still confused about** 🤔
>
*Although I read the definition of branches and forks through github and briefly understand the process of using it, I'm still slightly confused about how branches and forks are used, and I'm interested in working on coding projects where we can use branches and forks, so I can better understand it.*
